# Bayesian-Networks-for-Censored-data

The project ‘Bayesian Network for Censored Data’ aims to build a Bayesian Network on a censored dataset and perform the survival analysis based on the Bayesian Network. The Bayesian network will define the relationships between random variables and infer knowledge from the distributions. For our dataset, we have decided to perform survival analysis using Kaplan Meier model and Cox Proportional Model using Frequentist and Bayesian approach.
